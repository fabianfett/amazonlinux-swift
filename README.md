# amazonlinux-swift

⚠️ With Swift now officially supporting Amazon Linux 2 this project is not updated anymore. It remains here only for documentation purposes.

Apple does not build Swift for any other Linux distribution besides
Ubuntu. Therefore it is in the hands of the community to bring Swift
to other distributons. This project wants to support Swift on the 
Server by bringing it to Amazon Linux.

This project creates three build artifacts for every Swift release:

1. An installable Swift binary
2. A Docker image that runs Swift based off the amazonlinux image
3. A Swift layer to run Swift natively on AWS Lambda. A perfect fit for my [`Lambda Runtime`](https://github.com/fabianfett/swift-lambda-runtime)

You can download the binaries at:
https://fabianfett.de/amazonlinux-swift

You download the Docker images at:
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/fabianfett/amazon-linux-swift

You can download the layer from:
